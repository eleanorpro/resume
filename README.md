#Resume Page

This project was created with the Code Institute Full Stack Web Development course, bootstrap, CSS and HTML have all 
been used to create it, as well as Google Fonts and Font Awesome icons.

I need to edit the downloadable CV as it is currently a black CV template. Currently the contact form does not go 
anywhere and the social media links do not work. 

I will also edit the text as I progress through the course so that the information is correct.
